# Boarding Management System

# Introduction

As university students, we were supposed to find a boarding place in our second year since we were not offered a residence hostel during that time. Finding a rental place was a challenging task in the Kandy and Peradeniya area. Some of the challenges that we faced during finding rental places are,

- We have to travel long distances to get the information.
- A limited number of people know about the place.
- Due to the covid-19, we cannot travel freely.
- Have to depend on brokers and senior students a lot.
- Some places do not have the required facilities.
- Some places demand high rental fees.

Even though this is a challenging task we still donâ€™t have a proper system to solve this problem. Therefore as university students, we thought about building a system so that we can overcome the above-mentioned challenges.

## Setup the project

- Clone the project
- Go inside the project directory **( cd Boarding-Management-System )**
- Install the Laravel Composer **( composer install )**
- Generate the key for laravel project **( php artisan key:generate )**
- import the database file to mysql(BMS.sql)
- Setup Configurations in .env file(database configurations and Email configurations).

## Further Development

- You can develop according project to add university official boardings to the system. (You may need to introduce catergory information and some other new attribute to maintain those boardings)
- You can maintain those university boarding through the system. ( Cleanings, Arrangings, Assigning roooms to students, other student details )
- Improve the security of the system. (Only show partial information for the person who looking for boarding, add more secure ways to login register )
- Adding payment method (Through this, Boarding owner can receive the advance through system )
- Develop this project combining all sri lankan universities. ( Any university student in sri lanka will be able to find their approapiate boarding )
- Upadate the system into **Laravel 6.0** and Change the views to **vue js**.
